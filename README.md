# Analysis-On-Large-Real-World-Communication-Network-Using-Network-Science-Concepts

We are surrounded by systems that are hopelessly complicated. Consider for example the society that requires cooperation between billions of individuals, or communications infrastructures that integrate billions of cell phones with computers and satellites. Our biological existence is rooted in seamless interactions between thousands of genes and metabolites within our cells.

Given the important role complex systems play in our daily life, in science and in economy, their understanding, mathematical description, prediction, and eventually control is one of the major intellectual and scientific challenges.

The project aims to familiarize with the construction and analysis of large complex network which is a real-world communication network of E-mails exchanged in Enron company.
